#TicTacToe aka Noughts And Crosses

We work for a company that is building a tic-tac-toe game. There are several other teams working on various parts of 
the product: one team is building the AI, another is creating the user interface, yet another is building a system
that handles the gameplay mechanics, and so on. 

We need you to build a system that will evaluate a game board and determine if there is a winner or if there is no
winner. You will specify how the data should be given to the system you create. The other teams will conform to
whatever API you devise. For output, the other teams expect the strings: “X wins”, “O wins”, or “No winner”.

Assume we’re only caring about three-by-three boards. You don’t have to worry about validating the board. 
It’s entirely possible there’s a version of the game that handicaps one player by giving extra turns or squares. 
You only have to determine whether a winner is present.

You should assume your code is going to be deployed to production and at some later date someone will have to maintain
that code. So have empathy for that future engineer. That someone could be you.

For this project you can use any programming language you wish. You can access any reference material online or
locally. Feel free to make notes on paper, if you like. Finally, this is meant to be collaborative, and I’m your
product manager. You can ask me any questions, and while we’re working,
I may ask you questions to clarify decisions you’ve made.
