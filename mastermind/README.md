#Mastermind

Mastermind is a code breaking game. Given an unknown code consisting of four colored pegs in a specific order.
The player has to guess the code. The player can guess any four colors in any order.

The guess is then evaluated by presenting “scoring pegs.” A black peg indicates you have guessed a correctly colored
peg in the correct position. A white peg indicates you have guessed a correctly colored peg in the wrong position.

The ordering of the scoring pegs is random and does not indicate anything about the positions of the colored pegs.

Write a solution to evaluate various guesses against a known board.
